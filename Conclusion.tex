\section{\textbf{Conclusion}}
In this paper, we have presented suspicious Bangla text detection strategies using different machine learning models, evaluated them and showed a comparison of accuracy between this models. We get maximum accuracy of 92$\%$ using logistic regression. support vector machine and other algorithms also get mentionable accuracy on our dataset. The overall accuracy of all algorithms can be increased by removing more stop words and by increasing size of the dataset.\par

In future, we plan to use deep learning approach to find semantic relation between words of a text which will help us to predict more accurately. We are planing to construct larger dataset to increase accuracy, efficiency and reliability of our system.
