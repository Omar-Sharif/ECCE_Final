Suspicious Bangla text detection is a text classification problem of classifying Bangla text into suspicious and non suspicious category. In this paper, we have implemented a system using logistic regression and also found out the performance of different statistical machine learning algorithm for detecting suspicious Bangla text. To the best of our knowledge, it is the very first work on detecting suspicious Bangla text so we have to develop a corpus containing suspicious Bangla text. This paper shows comparison of accuracy for different machine learning algorithm which will be helpful to others. The experimental result shows maximum accuracy of 92\% for logistic regression using 1500 training documents and 500 testing documents. The overall accuracy can be increased by increasing the number of text documents in the dataset and considering semantic relations between words of a sentence.
